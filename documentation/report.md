# A mixed flatfish fisheries application in FLasher

Finlay Scott, Jan Jaap Poos, Iago Mosqueira

## Introduction

Many demersal fisheries catch mixed fisheries, where a multitude of species contribute to the output of the fishery (Poos et al. 2010). In such mixed fisheries, different fleets fishing in the same area may have different "target species", but the species that they catch may overlap. Setting single species quota in such fisheries systems may result in high-grading and overquota discarding, where parts of the catch are thrown overboard in order to be able to fish when quotas of one or more stocks are exhausted.

The management of these mixed fisheries is an area of concern: how can these fisheries be sustainably managed, reducing the incentives for discarding on the one hand, while safeguarding the future reproduction of the stocks in these mixed fisheries. Simulations based on Management Strategy Evaluation (Kell et al. 2007) can be an important tool to address these questions. Such tools rely on algortihms that can project the dynamics of populations under different management regimes. 

Within the FLR framework, FLasher has been developed to be a mixed fisheries projection model. Starting from a population with known properties, targets and constraints can be set to fisheries inputs (e.g. fishing effort) and output (e.g. catches) in different time periods, and for different fleets. The North Sea demersal mixed fisheries can potentially be used as a case study to test the application of FLasher. To this end, the life-history and fisheries characteristics needed to collated, and a simple FLasher based MSE needed to be parameterized based on these characteristics.

## Goal
To parameterize a MSE using FLasher based on flatfish stocks in the demersal fisheries of the North Sea 

## Methods 
The basis of the MSE is a set of stocks that are defined by their life-history characteristics. There are a number if flstfish stocks in the North Sea tat are of interest (Gillis et al. : plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea)  In order to parameterize the MSE
